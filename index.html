		<h2>My Background</h2>
		<p class="bodytext">I'm Julia, and I love dogs! I have become my coworkers' go-to dog boarder and sitter, and I have walked over 20 different breeds. I've passed a situational test, a harness test, and maintain a perfect rating on my walker profile. Nothing makes me happier than animal companionship! I'd love to take your pup for a quick walk around the neighborhood to burn off some energy or spend time with them while you're away for a sitting or boarding! I treat every dog as if they were my own, since as a student, I'm not in a place to have my own to care for right now. My customer service background, attention to detail and genuine care for all animals will ensure that you and your pup will have a great experience.</p>
